	<h4>COGS 187A</h4>
	<p>In this class, taken during the summer of 2016, I learned about Usability in Information Architecture by working with a team
		through the needfinding, logo design, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing, to create a usable product that makes intuitive sense.</p>
	<p>A week-by-week breakdown is available <a href="https://medium.com/@ncampbell/practicing-design-in-cogs-187a-at-ucsd-8ca65c05783d#.o3fedpvn0">here</a>.

	<h4>Personal Portfolio</h4>
	<p>In the same class, I used bootstrap to quickly make a personal porfolio, which is available <a href="http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~ncampbel/">here</a>.
